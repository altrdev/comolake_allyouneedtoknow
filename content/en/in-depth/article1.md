### **Miascia: how to cook the traditional Como Lake's pie**

**INGREDIENTS**
150 g stale bread
4 dl milk
1 spoon plain flour
1 spoon corn flour (optional)
30 g raisin
1 egg
1 Golden apple
1 pear
1 lemon (rind, optional)
1 little bunch of white grape
1 little branch of rosmary (optional)
50 g sugar
40 g butter
1 pinch of salt

**DIFFICOLTA'** 1 / 5

**TEMPO** 20 min + 60 min cooking

**COOKING** Preheaten oven, 180°C for one hour.

**PREPARATION**
Roughly chop the bread and leave it covered with milk to soak. Let it rest. In the menwhile, soak the raisin too with water.
Once the bread is soaked, add a pinch of salt, sugar, the flour(s), the egg, the soaked raisin, the lemon rind and all the other well cut fresh fruits.

Keep in mind that this is a leftover recipe, so it can vary based on what you've got in your fridge and pantry. You can **change ingredients** for instance by adding more dried fruit (nuts, walnuts, pine nuts) or more fresh fruits.

Pour the dough into a tin and cover the mixture with little flakes of butter and, if you'd like to, with some rosmary too.
Put it in a preheaten oven at 180°C for around 60 minutes.
The result is a very rich and aromatic moist cake.
